# ECSE - 425 Project P4: Pipelined Processor

This deliverable consists of a pipelined implementation, in VHDL, of a simplified MIPS processor. 

We implemented a standard five-stage pipelined 32-bit MIPS processor in VHDL.  A pipelined processor stores control signals and intermediate results associated with each executing instruction in pipeline registers between stage. 

# To run the program

## Generate the instruction code
To generate the instruction data, using the Driver provided in \Assembler:
1. Write your code in instructions.asm
2. Compile the assembler using `javac Driver.java`
3. Assemble using `java Driver instructions.asm`
4. Move the generated program.txt file in the root folder
