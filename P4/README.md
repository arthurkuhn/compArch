## P4: Pipelined Processor

This deliverable consists of a pipelined implementation, in VHDL, of a simplified MIPS processor. 

We implemented a standard five-stage pipelined 32-bit MIPS processor in VHDL.  A pipelined processor stores control signals and intermediate results associated with each executing instruction in pipeline registers between stage.
